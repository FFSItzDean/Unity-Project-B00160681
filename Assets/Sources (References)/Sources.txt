I have used a couple of different sources, all of these are from and found in the
unity asset store. The names of each source are found in my assets folder on the projects tab.
I altered some to suit my game like the wheel alignment on the "Sports Car" and the shades of colours
in the Polytope Studio. The car controller script was written by me (Dean Smith B00160681). 
I also used the cinemachine component to assist with making my camera follow the car.
I have not used any third party tutorial besides the one uploaded by unity developers
on how to fully use the cinemachine. The EasyRoads asset is an asset that creates the road
whichever way i want to implement it into my scene.

For the updates post alpha submission I made many more scripts,
to help the game run better and to make the game more consistent with playing.
I did add a progression system so that the game does get increasingly difficult to continue playing.
I made sure to add a simple song in the background that did not jeopardize the age group it was directed at.
I did have to search online on some simple things due to me forgetting (eg. how to update the timer.) however,
I only used videos published by unity devs themselves to ensure that the code i was using could be modified,
which i did do to fit my needs. I know I did not include some small things like the github link button,
however i only realised this after i had already finished the project. I believe I've met most criteria for this project,
and i hope you have enjoyed playing it.

I have not imported any other sources/assets to aid me. I only have the same ones from my alpha.
I also did do this project by myself as there was no one that i knew who was not in a group already so I hope this was okay.
I look forward to hearing what you have to say about my project.
