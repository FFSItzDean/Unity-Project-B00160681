// I have used a couple of different sources, all of these are from and found in the
// unity asset store. The names of each source are found in my assets folder on the projects tab.
// I altered some to suit my game like the wheel alignment on the "Sports Car" and the shades of colours
// in the Polytope Studio. The car controller script was written by me (Dean). 
// I also used the cinemachine component to assist with making my camera follow the car.
// I have not used any third party tutorial besides the one uploaded by unity developers
// on how to fully use the cinemachine. The EasyRoads asset is an asset that creates the road
// whichever way i want to implement it into my scene.
